## About Contributor Attribution

### GitHub Contributor Count

If you notice that GitHub shows more contributors than appear in the git history, this is due to how GitHub tracks contributions:

1. **Pull Request Authorship**: GitHub permanently associates PR authors with the repository, even if commits are later rebased or rewritten
2. **Issue & PR Comments**: Users who comment on issues or pull requests are counted as contributors
3. **Code Reviews**: Reviewers are included in the contributor count
4. **Metadata Caching**: GitHub caches contributor data and updates it on its own schedule

### Git History vs GitHub Contributors

The git history in this repository has been curated through rebasing to maintain a clean commit history. This means:

- Git log shows only current commit authors
- GitHub's contributor graph may show historical contributors
- The `.mailmap` file consolidates identities at the git level

This is a normal part of maintaining a clean git history and does not indicate any issues with the repository.

## Historical Context

Previous contributors' work has been integrated into the main development through rebasing operations. All current code is maintained and attributed to the active project owner.
