## About Contributor List

### Git History vs GitHub Contributor View

**Important Note:** This repository's git history has been cleaned and rebased to maintain accurate contributor information. All commits in the current branches reflect the actual work done by active contributors.

However, GitHub's contributor view may temporarily show additional names due to:
- **GitHub's Caching**: GitHub caches contributor data and updates it periodically
- **Historical Data**: GitHub may retain contributor information from previous states
- **Repository Forks**: Forks and branches may have different contributor lists

### Git Attribution

This repository uses a `.mailmap` file to ensure consistent contributor attribution across all git operations. This helps maintain:
- Accurate contribution tracking
- Consistent identity mapping
- Proper credit attribution
